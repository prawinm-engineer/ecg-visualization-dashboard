# ECG Visualization and HRV Analysis Dashboard

## Overview
This project implements a Python-based dashboard for visualizing ECG signals
and displaying basic Heart Rate Variability (HRV) parameters.
The goal is to present ECG data in a clear, interpretable format
similar to how clinicians and researchers review physiological signals.

This is an academic biomedical engineering project focused on
signal visualization and interpretation.

## Input Data
• ECG data acquired from AD8232 via Arduino or pre-recorded ECG files  
• Data loaded from serial communication or CSV format  

> Raw ECG data is not included in this repository.

## Functionality
• Plot raw ECG waveform  
• Visualize RR intervals  
• Display HRV parameters (Mean RR, SDNN, RMSSD)  
• Assist in quick signal quality and stress-related assessment  

## Tools & Technologies
• Python  
• NumPy, SciPy  
• Matplotlib  
• Biomedical signal processing concepts  

## Use Case
This dashboard can be used for:
• Educational demonstrations  
• Preliminary ECG signal review  
• Signal quality inspection before analysis  

## Disclaimer
This tool is for **educational and research purposes only**  
and is **not intended for clinical diagnosis or medical use**.
